1. Convert One String to Another: This problem involves transforming one string into another by performing a minimal number of operations such as insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and then combine the results to find the optimal solution.

2. House Robber Problem: In this problem, you are given a list of houses with a certain amount of money in each house. The goal is to maximize the amount of money you can rob without robbing adjacent houses. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to recursively divide the list of houses into smaller subproblems and combine the results to find the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.

3. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): The LCS problem involves finding the longest subsequence that is common to two given sequences. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to break down the problem into smaller subproblems by considering different possibilities and then combine the results to find the longest common subsequence.

4. Longest Palindromic Subsequence: This problem involves finding the longest subsequence that is a palindrome in a given sequence. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to recursively divide the sequence into smaller subproblems and combine the results to find the longest palindromic subsequence.

5. Minimum Cost to Reach the Last Cell: In this problem, you are given a grid with costs assigned to each cell. The goal is to find the minimum cost to reach the last cell from the top-left cell by moving only rightwards or downwards. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to divide the grid into smaller subgrids and combine the results to find the minimum cost.

7. Number of Paths to Reach the Last Cell: In this problem, you are given a grid with obstacles and the goal is to find the number of unique paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, while avoiding the obstacles. The Divide and Conquer approach can be used to divide the grid into smaller subgrids and combine the results to find the total number of paths
